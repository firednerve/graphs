# graphs
A C library for plotting graphs. While rudimentary, it can be used for easy plotting projects.
This library makes use of cairo and sds-master libraries as dependencies. These libraries come installed with the graphs library itself. The example.c code contains
an example program. The library itself is contained within graphs.h.
